# Vue 3 binding to @labir/core

This package is experimental. Generally, it should do the same thing for Vue as `@labir/react-bridge` does for React.

## Work in progress!

So far, we proved the integration of `@labir/core` is possible. It is working well. But Vue is not amongst our current priorities, because we focus on:

- React for SPA applications
- webcomponents for embedding in Wordpress, Moodle & other educational softwares
