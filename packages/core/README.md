# Thermal imaging in TS

Clinet side classes for work with thermal images.

## Core functionality

- loading of files
- displaying of files
- grouping of files
- control of thermal display parameters

## Framework agnostic

This package is intentionally written independently on any frontend framework. It might be implemented in any one. So far, we have been working on those integrations:

- React: `@labir/react-bridge`
- Vue 3: `@labir/vue` (experimental)
- Web components: `@labir/embed`

See the docs for more information.

## Contribution welcome

The core seems ready & tested. What can be done is **reading more file formats**.
