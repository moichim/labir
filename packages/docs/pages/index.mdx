# LabIR Edu

> TypeScript and React libraries for reading & analysis of thermal images.

↓ Display images from thermal cameras in the browser!

<thermal-file-app url="/tucnaci_04.lrc"></thermal-file-app>

↑ Control their display parameters (we have [much more](/react-bridge/components) than the temperature scale you see here)
