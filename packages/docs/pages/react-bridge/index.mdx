# React binding to @labir/core

This package provides fundamental integration of `@labir/core` in React:

- [context](context) and [hooks](hooks) for `@labir/core` classes
- [hooks](components) for creation of buttons, dropdowns & modals that will controll the `@labir/core` internal state
- three specific UI [components](components) for thermal imaging: `Histogram`, `ThermalRange` `ThermalInastance`

See `@labir/core` [documentation](/core) to understand the general contept ([structure](/core/overview) and [properties](/core/properties)).

## Foundation for final UIs

This package creates the main logic and bindings to the `@labir/core`. But the final UI needs to be implemented in a particular SCSS framework. We have the following implamentations:

- `@labir/tailwind` - TailwindCSS & NextUI
- `@labir/emotion` - @emotion/react

Components in those packages use hooks from `@labir/react-bridge` to handle the logic, but the styling is done individually.

Only three specific [components](components) are provided by this package. Their styling is inline and absolutely isolated from any other CSS that might appear on the page.
