# Hooks

Using hooks, React components know and manipulate the [structure classes](/core/overview) and the [properties](/core/properties-concept) of the global `ThermalManager` object.

## Getting structure ojects

- `useThermalManager` - get the global instance of `ThermalManager`
- `useThermalRegistry( registryId, options )` - create or get an instance of `ThermalRegistry`

## Properties that might be manipulated from React

- `useThermalManagerPaletteDrive` - color palette
- `useThermalRegistryOpacityDrive` - IR / VISIBLE ratio
- `useThermalRegistryRangeDrive` - adjustable temperature range
- `useThermalGroupCursorPositionDrive` - cursor synchronisation

## States of which React needs to know

- `useThermalRegistryHistogramState` exposes the current histogram
- `useThermalRegistryLoadingState` exposes current loading state
- `useThermalRegistryMinmaxState` exposes the min & max temperature of a registry
- `useThermalGroupMinmaxState` exposes the min & max temperature of a group

## Hooks for components

Many actions related to thermal display, we need buttons, dropdowns and other common components. For those, there are hooks, that takes care of the inner logic.

See [Components][components] page for details.

## Listing

- `useThermalRegistryGroupsState` groups in a registry
- `useThermalGroupInstancesState` file instances in a group

## Complex scenarios

There are hooks simplifying the most common use cases:

`useSingleFileRegistry`

- Intended for display of one single image in an isolated registry
- Handles its loading
- Creates an isolated registry for this particular file

## Utility hooks

`useThermalObjectPurpose` - creates unique ID for individual components
