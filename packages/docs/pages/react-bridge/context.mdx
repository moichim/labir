# Thermal Context

All componenst need to be nested by `<ThermalProvider />` which creates the global instance of `ThermalManager`. All hooks and components work internally with this `ThermalManager` object.

```jsx

    <ThermalProvider>
        {/** Nested components may use hooks from @labir/react-bridge */}
    </ThermalProvider>

```

Hooks that use the global `ThermalManager` object are described [here](hooks).
