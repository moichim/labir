# Webcomponents

We are currently working on webcomponents integration using [Lit](https://lit.dev/). The work is very much in progress.

## Example

A single image app what shall be embedded in any Wordpress, Moodle or other LMS.

```html
<thermal-manager>
  <thermal-registry uuid="tucnaks">
    <thermal-group>
      <thermal-file-app url="/tucnaci_04.lrc"></thermal-file-app>
    </thermal-group>
  </thermal-registry>
</thermal-manager>
```

<thermal-manager>
  <thermal-registry uuid="tucnaks">
    <thermal-group>
      <thermal-file-app url="/tucnaci_04.lrc"></thermal-file-app>
    </thermal-group>
  </thermal-registry>
</thermal-manager>



## Aim

In order to use thermal imaging in Wordpress, Moodle and other old-fashioned tools, we need a "Youtube-like" way of embedding. We chose webcomponents for that purpose.

The entire [internal structure](/core) of @labir/core is being implemented to webcomponents wich allows:

- to construct the entire app hierarchy using custom HTML elements
- to dynamically set parameters such as temperature scale or palette using `setAttribute`

So far, we provide these elements:

- `<thermal-manager>`
- `<thermal-registry>`
- `<thermal-group>`
- `<thermal-file>`

Main challenges:

- handle dependency injection using Lit's context mechanism
- handle dynamic loading of images caused by DOM manipulation
